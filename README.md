## Lock Your Keyboard Using Keyboard Locker

Keyboard Locker was initially a small AutoHotKey script written by an AutoHotkey named Lexikos. Now, it has developed into a small program and takes up few system resources. With it, you can complete the task with ease.

Step 1: Download the small program from here.
Step 2: Unzip the downloaded folder and then open it.
Step 3: You will see several files inside the folder. Double-click the KeyboardLocker.exe file if you donâ€™t have AutoHotKey installed; Double-click the keyboardLocker.ahk file if you do have AutoHotKey installed.
Step 4: Press Ctrl+Alt+L to lock your keyboard. After that, you will see a prohibition mark against the keyboard icon, which means you have successfully locked your keyboard.

## How do I Lock the Number Keys on a Dell Laptop?

* Press the "Fn" key, normally located in the lower left corner of the keyboard next to the "CTRL" key, and the "F11" key at the same time. Depending on the particular Dell laptop model, the "F11" key may say "Num Lock" or may have an icon of a keypad.
* Use the numeric keypad the way you would on a full-size keyboard. The keys are marked with their keypad function in the lower left area of the key. For example, on the "J" key you will see a "1," usually in light blue or grey.
* Switch between the keypad numbers and letters by pressing the "Fn" key with the corresponding key. For instance, if you have the keypad lock activated, pressing "Fn"with the "O" key will produce an"o" instead of a "6." To continue using the numeric keypad, release the "Fn" key.
* Input a capital letter with the numeric keypad locked by pressing the "Fn," "Shift" and corresponding keys at the same time.
* Exit the numeric keypad lock by pressing the "Fn" key with the "F11" key.
